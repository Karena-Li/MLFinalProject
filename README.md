#### Project.Rmd
It contains the code of  
1. data preparation (variables selction and transcoding).
2. Model built by desicion tree, random forest, KNN, multinomial logistc regression methods.
3. The confusion matrix, accuracy, ROC plot of each model.
  
  
#### Server.R & UI.R
This is a web App for predicting obesity level made by Shiny.  
  
You will get the prediction of your future obesity level as well as the necessary suggestion for your health according to the prediction.
